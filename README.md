# Generating and plotting larval dispersal trajectories from a biophysical model 

This script creates larval dispersal trajectories from Xuereb et al. 2021. (Accepted in Proceedings B as part of the RCN Evolution in Changing Seas Special Feature). Original data comes from a biophysical model of larval transport for the lobster in the Gulf of Maine published by Xue et al. (2008). Daily particle positions are plotted for three years (2002, 2003, 2004) following release on June 01.
