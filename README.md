# Generating and plotting larval dispersal trajectories from a biophysical model 

This script creates the dispersal trajectories used in Xuereb et al. 2021. (Accepted in Proceedings B as part of the RCN Evolving Seas Special Feature). 

Original data comes from a biophysical model of larval dispersal for the lobster in the Gulf of Maine published by Xue et al. (2008).
